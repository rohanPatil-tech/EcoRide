# EcoRide
This project is to create EcoRide, a car rental platform that is user-friendly as well as environmentally conscious. The web app will offer a hassle-free experience for both renters and car owners, along with a novel idea of a rewards system based on eco-points. These points are earned through car ratings and mileage. Car owners can list their vehicles, update information, keep track of their rental history and earn eco-points based on their carâ€™s performance. Renters can book cars, manage their reservations, and earn eco-points for using fuel efficiently. Both owners and renters will have access to their past data and rewards, aiming for a more interactive and responsible experience.
